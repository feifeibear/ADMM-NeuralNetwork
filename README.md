# ADMM-NeuralNetwork
ADMM-NeuralNetwork was implemented by a potato

I implemented ADMM-NeuralNetwork based on this paper: Taylor, Gavin, et al. "Training neural networks without gradients: A scalable admm approach." International Conference on Machine Learning. 2016.

# Requirements
- MATLAB version >= R2015a
- ADMM-NeuralNetwork can only has GPU version; therefore, MATLAB and system have to support it.

# Neural Network Achitecture
- NN has 2 hidden layers. You can change it in NeuralNetwork.m and main.m
- I use Relu for activation function and least square for loss function.

# How to run
- Run main.m
